## Introduction

Welcome to the MCP Labs - a comprehensive, hands-on guide to mastering the Model Context Protocol! 

Whether you're new to MCP or looking to deepen your understanding, this learning series will take you from fundamentals to building production-ready MCP servers.

---

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). 

Think of it as a universal adapter that allows AI applications to connect to various data sources, tools, and services in a consistent and scalable way.

---

## What You'll Learn

Through hands-on labs, you'll:

-  **Understand MCP Architecture** - Master the client-server model and protocol fundamentals
-  **Build MCP Servers** - Create servers from scratch using TypeScript and the official SDK
-  **Implement Tools** - Develop functions that LLMs can call to perform actions
-  **Expose Resources** - Provide contextual data that LLMs can read and reference
-  **Create Prompts** - Build reusable templates for common tasks
-  **Deploy to Production** - Apply best practices for real-world applications

---

## Learning Path

This course consists of **5 progressive labs**, each building on the previous one:

### [Lab 1: MCP Fundamentals](Lab01-MCP-Fundamentals/index.md)
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

Understand what MCP is, why it exists, and learn the core architecture and concepts.

<br>

### [Lab 2: Building Your First MCP Server](Lab02-First-MCP-Server/index.md)
**Duration:** 1-1.5 hours

Build a complete, working MCP server from the ground up with hands-on coding.

<br>


### [Lab 3: Implementing MCP Tools](Lab03-MCP-Tools/index.md)
**Duration:** 1.5-2 hours

Master creating sophisticated tools that interact with external systems like APIs, files, and databases.

<br>


### [Lab 4: Implementing MCP Resources](Lab04-MCP-Resources/index.md)
**Duration:** 1-1.5 hours

Learn to expose contextual data through resources and understand the difference between tools and resources.

<br>


### [Lab 5: MCP Prompts and Complete Integration](Lab05-MCP-Prompts/index.md)
**Duration:** 1.5-2 hours

Complete your MCP education with prompts, production best practices, and deployment strategies.

<br>

### [Lab 6: K-Agent Integration](Lab06-K-Agent/index.md)
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

Implement a specialized MCP server (K-Agent) that interacts with Kubernetes clusters to provide AI-driven log collection and analysis.

---

### [Tasks](Lab01-MCP-Fundamentals/lab1-tasks.md/)
**Duration:** Varies

A dedicated section with exercises and challenges to reinforce your learning from all labs.
